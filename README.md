# vagrant_docker_java_example
An example of compiling a provided Java Spring Boot application in a Docker container running on a Centos 7.6 Linux virtual machine in turn part of a virtual network of Oracle Virtualbox VMs orchestrated by the Vagrant tool. Everything is installed from scratch as the starting point of a continuous delivery system. In addition and as an aside, an Ansible playbook also sets up and configures an Apache web server along with port mapping to the host.

You can view a demo of this code on Youtube at https://youtu.be/tehnIInLxns

To use this code, you will need an internet-enabled PC with at least 4 GB of RAM, Vagrant, Oracle Virtualbox and a Linux prompt (Cygwin on Windows). If you are a Windows 7 or 10 user and have Administrator privileges, see my Powershell script project which will set these up for you with minimum hassle.

Please read the how-to.txt file for additional details.

After viewing the video demo, if you are confused but eager to learn more, I recommend the Pluralsight courses on Vagrant and Docker by Wes Higbee, Ansible by Aaron Paxson, and Cloud Deployment by Justin Menga.
