Requirements:

Internet enabled PC.

If you are using Windows, make sure all Windows Updates are concluded, that your sytem is up 
to date and that no updates are pending waiting for a reboot.

You will need Vagrant, Oracle Virtualbox and (on Windows) Cygwin installed.

Windows users: see https://github.com/bertrandszoghy/powershell_vagrant_install

This will create a private network of 3 Linux CentOs virtual machines:
ans
web
db

The ans machine will be the Ansible master.


How to use:

Copy files to target folder (as an example, I used C:\Vagrantboxes\mynetwork).

On Windows:

Open Cygwin Terminal (or Cygwin64 Terminal for 64bit Windows)

Type the commands:

cd /cygdrive/c/Vagrantboxes/mynetwork
vagrant up

On Windows you will need to accept the security prompt indicating that Virtualbox wants to alter the network adapter configuration.

Be patient.

An Ansible playbook will be launched, installing Apache web server on the web vm and copuying over content to it. 
The firewall is also disabled. To test all is working: in a browser on the Windows machine, go to:
http://localhost:8080

To log in to the image with SSH once it's ready (NO PASSWORD REQUIRED):

# ans is the name of one of the 3 vms that will be started (see Vagrantfile)
vagrant ssh ans

# to log out use CTRL-D or:
# exit

To bring down the image:

vagrant halt

To clean up everything:

vagrant destroy -f
